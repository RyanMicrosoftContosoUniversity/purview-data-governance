# Lab‑07: Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) – Speaker notes

## Purpose and goals

- Introduce **Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)** as a mechanism to align data governance work with business outcomes【231805501445427†L17-L40】.
- Demonstrate how to create and manage OKRs within Purview and link them to data products or domains.

## What are OKRs?

- **Objective**: a qualitative goal that clearly articulates what the domain or data product intends to achieve (e.g., “Improve customer data quality”).
- **Key results**: quantitative metrics that measure progress towards the objective (e.g., “Reduce missing values by 20% by Q3”)【231805501445427†L17-L40】.
- OKRs provide transparency, focus and alignment across teams.  They help convert strategy into measurable outcomes.

## Attributes of OKRs【231805501445427†L17-L40】

- **Owners**: individuals or teams accountable for achieving the objective and key results.
- **Definition**: a clear statement of what success looks like.
- **Target date**: when the objective should be achieved (e.g., by the end of a quarter).
- **Key results**: 1‑3 measurable outcomes that indicate success; they should be ambitious yet realistic.
- **Status and progress updates**: track the current state and adjust actions as necessary.

## Why include OKRs in data governance?

- Many data governance initiatives fail to demonstrate tangible value.  By linking activities to **objectives and metrics**, teams can track outcomes and demonstrate impact【231805501445427†L44-L54】.
- OKRs facilitate **cross‑team collaboration**, as they are public and align different domains towards common goals.
- They help prioritise work: data products or curation efforts that contribute to OKRs can be scheduled first.

## Creating OKRs in Purview

- Identify an **objective** relevant to data quality, compliance or business value (e.g., “Launch a unified customer data platform”).
- Define **key results** that can be measured with data from the Purview catalog (e.g., “Scan 90% of all data sources by end of quarter”).
- Assign **owners** for the objective and each key result; ensure accountability.
- Use the Purview portal to **add a new OKR**: provide objective title, description, target date and key results.
- Link the OKR to **data products** or **domains** so that it appears in context when users view those assets【231805501445427†L44-L54】.
- Periodically **update progress**: enter actual metrics and mark key results as achieved or on track.

## Lab tasks and walkthrough

- Brainstorm a few sample objectives with the participants (e.g., “Improve data quality for finance reports”).
- For each objective, identify 1‑2 key results and specify measurement criteria.
- In Purview, create **two OKRs** for the domain or product you worked on in earlier labs.
- Link each OKR to a data product or domain; show how the OKRs appear in the product overview page.
- Discuss how OKRs can drive prioritisation of curation, scanning and quality efforts.

## Tips for facilitators

- Encourage participants to choose **ambitious yet measurable goals**; avoid vague objectives.
- Emphasise that OKRs should be reviewed regularly; they are not static.
- Remind participants that linking OKRs to data products improves discoverability and cross‑team coordination【231805501445427†L44-L54】.
